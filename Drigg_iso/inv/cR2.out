 WARNING:  Rejecting reading 1041(number)       80(P+)  76(P-)       17(C+)  21(C-)      59983.06(App. Resistivity)

 Measurements read:  1364  Measurements rejected:    1
 NOTE: readings are rejected if the measured apparent resistivity falls outside the specified range
 Geometric mean of apparent resistivities:  0.12353E+03

 During the inversion measurements may be ignored because their polarity is not consistent
 with the forward model response. This is quite normal early on in the inversion but 
 (only for non-surface electrode surveys) the polarity of the forward model can change and
 these ignored measurements may then be incorporated in subsequent iterations.
 The number being ignored will be reported each iteration
